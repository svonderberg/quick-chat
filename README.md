A simple chat app written in TypeScript using React, Redux-Saga and Firebase Firestore.

Going directly to the [homepage](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/quick-chat/) will create a new chat room with a random human readable URL (via the [human readable ids library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/human-readable-ids)). Entering any path after /quick-chat/ will create a new room with that URL so you can create your own desired URL that way as well.

Supports Markdown via the [markdown-it library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it).
